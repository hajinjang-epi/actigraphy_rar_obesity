# actigraphy_rar_obesity

This repository contains analysis code supporting a longitudinal study examining the association between actigraphy-measured rest-activity rhythms (RAR) and obesity phenotypes in older men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study.
The code implements the full analytical workflow used in the study, including data preparation, derivation and categorization of RAR metrics, construction of obesity phenotypes (whole-body, abdominal, and sarcopenic obesity), and longitudinal modeling using generalized estimating equations (GEE).

The associated manuscript is included in this repository for reference.
